                <h2>Life gets us so caught up, we forget to stop and breathe</h2>
                <h3>As a child, we take life for what it is. Our conscience has not yet developed in a way where we are
                    able to think about all our experiences, we just live them. But, as we grow older, we grow more
                    aware of all the stimuli that surround us in our everday lives. Wheter it be our boss that pressures
                    us to work harder, our relationships that come and go, or even our little toe that is constantly
                    hurting from that biking accident. Stimuli are everywhere and always there, especially in such a
                    fast world like ours today. This makes coming back to yourself and your senses difficult. Luckily
                    there are multiple ways to get you back to your grounded self. Below there are three spectrums which
                    can help you find your grounded self again. Relax, enjoy yourself and dont forget to breathe.

                    <hr>
                    <p>One of the most popular ways to meditation while being physically active is movement meditation.
                        This type of meditation is a great option for you if you have trouble sitting still or if you
                        might feel sluggish and feel like a seated meditation will put you to sleep. Its a great way to
                        bring the attention to the body and to check yourself how you physically feel and to remind you
                        as the owner of this body to pay attention to it and treat it with the love and respect it
                        deserves. You only have one body, so give it the attention it deserves. Click the image to the

                    <hr>
                    <p>Mindfullness meditation is a great way to become awere of your own thoughts. By sitting in a
                        quiet non-distracting place and focusing on your breath, you will become more aware of your own
                        thoughts. And when you do, kindly ask yourself to focus back on your breath again to center
                        yourself with your own mind. This practice is well-known and one of the most effective ways to
                        get a grasp on your own mind again. Its a quick and easy way to filter all the stimuli that
                        occur in everyday life. Click the image to the left to be directed to the mental

            <hr>
            <p>Do you ever feel like you are too harsh on yourself? That everything you do isn't good enough? You keep
                getting frustrated with yourself because you feel like you're never good enough? Loving-kindess
                meditation could help you with just that. This type of meditation focuses itself on being aware of our
                negative emotions and helping us tackle those emotions and turn them in to compassion for ourselves. In
                this day and age we are pressured way too much on our performance. Well-being is less important and
                therefore we become our own enemies. This doesn't have to be. Click the image to the left to be directed
