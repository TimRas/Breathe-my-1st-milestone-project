                        As a child, we take life for what it is. Our consciousness has not yet developed in a way where we are able to think about all our experiences, we just live them. But, as we grow older, we grow more aware of all the
                        stimuli that surround us in our everday lives. Wheter it be our boss that pressures us to work harder, our relationships that come and go or even our little toe that is constantly hurting from that biking accident.
                        Stimuli are everywhere and always there, especially in such a fast world like ours today. This makes coming back to yourself and your senses difficult. Luckily there are multiple ways to get you back to your grounded
                        self. Below there are three spectrums which can help you find your grounded self again. Relax, enjoy yourself and dont forget to breathe.

                            One of the most popular ways to meditation while being physically active is movement meditation. This type of meditation is a great option for you if you have trouble sitting still or if you might feel sluggish
                            and feel like a seated meditation will put you to sleep. Its a great way to bring the attention to the body and to check yourself how you physically feel and to remind you as the owner of this body to pay
                            attention to it and treat it with the love and respect it deserves. You only have one body, so give it the attention it deserves. Click the image to be directed to the physical page and the steps to

                            Mindfullness meditation is a great way to become aware of your own thoughts. By sitting in a quiet non-distracting place and focusing on your breath, you will become more aware of your own thoughts. And when you
                            do, kindly ask yourself to focus back on your breath again to center yourself with your own mind. This practice is well-known and one of the most effective ways to get a grasp on your own mind again. Its a quick
                            and easy way to filter all the stimuli that occur in everyday life. Click the image to be directed to the mental page and the steps to your mindfullness meditation

                            Do you ever feel like you are too harsh on yourself? That everything you do isn't good enough? You keep getting frustrated with yourself because you feel like you're never good enough? Loving-kindess meditation
                            could help you with just that. This type of meditation focuses itself on being aware of our negative emotions and helping us tackle those emotions and turn them in to compassion for ourselves. In this day and age
                            we are pressured way too much on our performance. Well-being is less important and therefore we become our own enemies. This doesn't have to be. Click the image to be directed to the emotional page
