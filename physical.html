                    <h2>Step 1:</h2>
                    <p>
                        Pick a location where you wont be disturbed easily. This can be indoors or outdoors. Take off your shoes and softly plant your feet on the ground. Take a few deep breaths to make contact with your body. Feel your
                        feet touch the ground while trying to focus on each individual part of your feet. First your heels, then your soles and lasty your toes.

                    <h2>Step 2:</h2>
                    <p>
                        After you've conscienly made contact with the feeling of the ground with your feet, slowly take 10-15 steps while keeping your focus on the sensation of the ground touching your feet. After these steps, stand still
                        and focus on the sensation in your feet after walking these steps. Repeat this process as much times as necessary until you feel your attention focusing more on your body.

                            <p>
                                When your focus becomes more centered around the sensation of your feet, you can begin to focus on other parts of your body. This could be anything from your eyes to your fingers. Conscienly observe the body part you
                                focused on while you keep walking in a slow pace. By increasing your focus from the feet to any other body part, you widen your awareness of your body.

                            <p>
                                You can focus on all part of your body for as long as you like but when you feel like you've grounded yourself enough for how like you like, slowly walk to a place where you can sit while remaining aware of your body
                                parts and calmy sit down. Close your eyes for 5-10 minutes and observe the sensation and feelings running through your body. Its okay if your mind wanders, just gently come back to your focus of the body parts. When
                                you feel content, slowly open your eyes and take a few deep breaths.
